# Project Template

### Usage:

1. Navigate to https://github.com/gliedgroup/template.
2. Click the green `Use this template` button to make a new repo.
3. Create the repository under `gliedgroup` instead of your personal account (Check nesting)

### Folder Hierarchy

- `code`: Should contain all code modules, keep them organized as needed, all in here.
- `data`: Keep all data here locally, it might not be feasible to push all data files in Github. If you want to automatically exclude the files that are of `data` types then include the `data extension` to `.gitignore` file. Files with `.dta` extension in `data` folders will not be included by default.
- `doc` : All necessary data documentation
- `output`: Shareable results
- `pub`: Manuscripts/Visualizations etc
